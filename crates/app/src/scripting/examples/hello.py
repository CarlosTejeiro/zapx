"""Smallest ZAPX script: look at the focused tab and run one command.

Run it from Tools → Run Python script…, as a Dry run first: nothing is sent,
the panel lists what would be. Then choose Run. (Read-only runs it for real on
a FortiGate tab, where it types `get system status`; on another tab its
`uname -a` isn't in the default get/show list, so it is only logged.)
